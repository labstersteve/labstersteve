- 👋 Hi, I’m @labstersteve, Labster's engineering lead.
- 👀 I’m interested in growing the team as needed and enabling professional and personal growth for team members.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about talent development after a lifetime as a practising software engineer.
  I also still noodle in Python as a hobby, at present with `fastapi`, `pydantic` and `mongoengine`.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything and everything that helps team members to make their work more rewarding, fulfilling and fun.
- 📫 How to reach me: email steve@labster.com
